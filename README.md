# Fingerprinting diverse nanoporous materials for optimal hydrogen storage conditions using meta-learning

SorbMetaML is an open‚Äêsource meta-learning model for the prediction of unary adsorption for nanoporous materials based on example adsorption data for a material. SorbMetaML has been used to identify the optimal hydrogen storage temperature with the highest working capacity for a given pressure difference for diverse nanoporous materials. Datasets for the hydrogen adsorption of all-silica zeolites, hyper-cross-linked polymers, and metal-organic frameworks are provided.

The development of SorbMetaML is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences through the Nanoporous Materials Genome Center under award DE-FG02-17ER16362.
